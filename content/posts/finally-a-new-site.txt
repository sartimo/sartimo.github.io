title: Finally a new website!

# Finally a new website!

yes guys. i am again at a certain point where i need to say, it is again time to furtherly optimize my previous site.
this is the new site. and if you wonder, why it does look like nothing, let me explain. 

this site is written using a simple 53 loc bash script[0]. the bash script is used to generate a html 1.5 compliant site
using different variables. it dynamically generates this site by recompiling the newest posts into the list on the main site.

as for content, i decided to mainly use pure textfiles. textfiles are ultimately small and extremely portable. 
the final (non-minified!) overall size of this site is around ~526 bytes (4208 bits). the server-side latency variies around 170ms.

ultimately, i am pretty happy with the outcome. i do not think it is possible to furtherly optimize and minimize this site.
if you think you are able to do so, please reach out to me :)
