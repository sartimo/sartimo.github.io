title: Managing tasks

= Managing tasks using plaintext and bash

I have certainly become a type/plaintext fan. Therefore I like to manage my tasks using a kanban-like method
on the linux terminal. I wrote a modified todotxt cli to manage your tasks using plaintext on the terminal.

== Installation

Fetch the cli script using git:

$ git clone https://github.com/sartimo/todo

Then change into that directory:

$ cd todo

And then execute the script like that

$ ./todo

== Usage

You can simply add new tasks like that:

$ ./todo add "my new task"

An then list them like so:

$ ./todo ls
