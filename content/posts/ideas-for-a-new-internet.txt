= Ideas for a new standard

== Internet Protocol Version 14 (IPv14)

Let me introduce my conceptual IPv14 protocol. 
First of all, why v14? Idk. I googled and saw, that there are conceptual versions reaching up to v13, hence this name is v14.

Here is a common IPv4 address format:

x.x.x.x -> it contains four positions. Per position there will be 254 possible adresses.

**And here are the improvements.**

- Instead of 4 positions like IPv4, IPv14 will have 14 positions.
- Each position will be represented in octet format, similar to IPv4.
- Instead of 255 addresses per position, there will be 14 addresses per position, resulting in a significantly larger address space.
- Binary format will be used for addressing.
- Integrated IPsec Headers

Here's an example representation of an IPv14 address:

xxxx.xxxx.xxxx.xxxx.xxxx.xxxx.xxxx.xxxx.xxxx.xxxx.xxxx.xxxx.xxxx.xxxx
