title: Brief overview on IEEE 802.1x

= What is IEEE 802.1x (dot1x)

IEEE 802.1x from now on referred as dot1x is a protocol standardization by IEEE to enhance port-based security through authentication, autorisation and accounting (AAA). 

== Building blocks of IEEE 802.1x 

The main components for a dot1x network are:

- Supplicant: This is a common term for endpoints dealing with dot1x such as laptops, desktops and other devices
- Authenticator: This is a common term for the middle-ware used for configuring the network for the supplicant access after successfull authentication. Usually these are devices such as Switches.
- Authentication Server: This usually is a server or a service that processes the authentication and decides upon the authentication result based on multiple factors like a policy-ruleset. A common Auth-Server is the Cisco Identity-Services-Engine (ISE).

== Ways of authentication

There are several ways and methods that can lead to a successfully working dot1x implementation. Here are the most important ones covered.

=== EAP-TLS
