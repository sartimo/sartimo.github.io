# about me

*beep* this page is under construction *beep*

hi there,

My name is Timo Sarkar, and this is my blog. I currently work as a IT Systemsengineer. Due to my passion for technology, I built this blog to keep all my important thoughts and findings on one place. You can consider me a techno-dharmic visioneer and builder. I do mostly align with the principles of effective-accelerationism (e/acc).
